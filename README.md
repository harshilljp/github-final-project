# Simple Interest Calculator
A simple interest calculator is a tool used to calculate the interest amount on a principal sum over a period of time at a specific interest rate.

## Formula
The formula used to calculate simple interest is:
I = (P * R * T) / 100

Where:
* **I** = Simple Interest
* **P** = Principal Amount
* **R** = Annual Interest Rate (in %)
* **T** = Time (in years)

## Project Overview
This repository contains the documentation for a simple interest calculator project as part of the Git and GitHub fundamentals course.
